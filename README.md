## Introduction
This is the third project for the Udacity Cloud DevOps using Microsoft Azure Nanodegree Program, where we create disposable test environments and run a variety of automated tests with the click of a button. Additionally, we monitor and provide insight into an application's behavior, and determine root causes by querying the applicationâ€™s custom log files.

For this project we use the following tools:

- Azure DevOps: For creating a CI/CD pipeline to run Terraform scripts and execute tests with Selenium, Postman and Jmeter
- Terraform: For creating Azure infrastructure as code (IaS)
- Postman: For creating a regression test suite and publish the results to Azure Pipelines.
- Selenium: For creating a UI test suite for a website.
- JMeter: For creating a Stress Test Suite and an Endurance Test Suite.
- Azure Monitor: For configuring alerts to trigger given a condition from an App Service.

## Getting Started
Due to using a Udacity Cloud Lab a Service Principal is already given.
For this project we will perform the following steps:
1. Install our dependencies
2. Configure storage account and state backend for Terraform
4. Configure Pipeline Environment
5. Configure an Azure Log Analytics Workspace
6. Create Postman Test Suites
7. Create a Selenium test for a website
8. Create a Test Suite with JMeter
9. Enable Monitoring & Observability

## Install our dependencies
For the successful run of this project we need to do the following steps:
1. Install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Create an Outlook Account: https://outlook.live.com/
3. Create a free Azure Account: https://azure.microsoft.com/
4. Create an Azure Devops account: https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/
5. Install Azure CLI: https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest
6. Install Terraform: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli#install-terraform
7. Install the Java Development Kit: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html

9. Install Postman: https://www.postman.com/downloads/
10. Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
11. Install Selenium for Python: https://pypi.org/project/selenium/
12. Install Chromedriver: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

## Configure storage account and state backend for Terraform
Terraform state is used to reconcile deployed resources with Terraform configurations. State allows Terraform to know what Azure resources to add, update, or delete. 
For the project we will use Azure Storage for persisting the Terraform state in remote storage. For this we will run the ```terraformconfig.sh``` file, which has the necessary configuration for creating a blob storage to store the state.

We jump into the terraform folder and run the script:

cd Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/terraform
chmod +x terraformconfig.sh
./terraformconfig.sh

We will get 3 outputs:
- storage_account_name
- container_name 
- access_key

We will use these variables and put it into the following file:
terraform/environments/test/main.tf

```
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    storage_account_name = ""
    container_name       = ""
    key                  = ""
    access_key           = ""
  }
}
```
We are now ready to configure an Azure DevOps Pipeline.

## Configure Azure Pipelines
We will need to install Terraform extension from Microsoft DevLabs to use terraform in our DevOps Project, install it (after having created the project)
by going to Organization Settings/General/Extensions/Browse Marketplace and click on terraform extension icon.

Now we need to create a new Service Connection in the Project by going to Project Settings -> Service connections -> New service connection -> Azure Resource Manager -> Service Principal (Automated). Name the new service connection to Azure Resource Manager as ```myServiceConnection```.
This service connection will be used in the ```azure-pipelines.yml``` file.

The next step is to upload our ```terraform.tvars``` to Azure Devops as a Secure File, to do this we have to navigate to Pipelines -> Library -> Secure Files -> + Secure File -> Upload File. Now the file should be uploaded.

Further ahead when the pipeline is created, remember to go into the "Pipeline permissions" menu by clicking in the file name in the "Secure Files" menu and add the pipeline that we will be using.

We are ready to run the Provision stage of our pipeline.

If all the configuration was correct, then the terraform apply command should be successful, and our resources should be deployed to the cloud.

![Terraform_Apply](https://github.com/brem02/Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/assets/122722304/111d9492-6f8c-4dd6-b33f-58d93548eec5)


## Configure Pipeline Environment
After Terraform deploys the VM in Azure we need to manually register the Virtual Machine in Pipelines -> Environments -> TEST -> Add resource -> Virtual Machines -> Linux. Then copy the registration script and manually log into the virtual machine (via SSH), paste it in and run the script.

![Create_Environment](https://github.com/brem02/Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/assets/122722304/6ba93d39-cdef-48ef-a67c-512bc09b4b87)

![Configure_Environment](https://github.com/brem02/Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/assets/122722304/f918fd80-a4d2-40b1-9f9c-024584f37d1e)

This enables Azure Pipelines to run commands in that Virtual Machine. 


## Create Postman Test Suites
For this part we will use Postman and Newman to test each endpoint of the web app available in the ```fakerestapi``` folder. We will use Postman to test the endpoints, and when we are done we will download their definitions in .json and then use them in our project to run them using Newman in the Azure Pipeline.

We created both regression tests and validation tests, and an environment to store our variables. Also, we defined the publishing of test results to Test Plans of Azure Devops.

Please note, that the API that we are testing (http://dummy.restapiexample.com) is quite unstable as it recieves a lot of traffic, so some calls to the endpoints might fail with an error code and test results may vary according to the time of usage.

After we run the Postman tests in our pipeline we can get Test Results in Test Plans -> Runs -> Postman Test Results. We get the following result in the Run Summary page:

![Postman_Test_Results_01](https://github.com/brem02/Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/assets/122722304/d9ab9f70-6b19-49dd-bdba-3c5ff952974f)

![Postman_Test_Results_02](https://github.com/brem02/Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/assets/122722304/966476e7-e04e-4734-99b8-d7e99dae1b63)

![Postman_Test_Results_03](https://github.com/brem02/Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/assets/122722304/17eb6f08-bb71-4912-a8ba-588c7535eee8)


In the Pipeline run we can check the logs of the publishing of the test results.

![Postman_Publishing](https://github.com/brem02/Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/assets/122722304/5b2cc7ea-5c77-492f-b695-d1647ebec745)


## Create a Selenium test for a website
For this part of the project we will use selenium-test.py file and run it in a "headless" mode.

We included the website https://www.saucedemo.com/ in order to test login, add 6 items to cart and remove those 6 items afterwards.

In the Azure Pipeline Job section we can check the logs of the Selenium Test.

![Selenium_Test_Result](https://github.com/brem02/Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/assets/122722304/3b8a9e29-3914-435a-af6e-e31e890ada44)

We also defined an artifact that contains the logs for all Selenium runs.

![Selenium_Publishing](https://github.com/brem02/Udacity_Azure_Devops_Project_03/assets/122722304/115d5423-ff50-4d07-a530-2cc77045e036)


## Create a Test Suite with JMeter
In this step we will create both endurance tests and stress tests with Apache JMeter.

Open the ```stress-test.jmx``` and ```endurance-test.jmx``` and navigate to the View Results Tree tab, run the test and then navigate to Tools -> Generate HTML Report, browse for the results file, the user.properties file and the output directory. Generate the HTML reports for both tests.

By running the tests in Azure Pipelines we can get summaries for both of them.

![Stress test](images/stresstest.PNG)

![Endurance test](images/endurancetest.PNG)

We also have JMeter Artifacts which we can download if we need

![JMeter artifacts](images/jmeterartifacts.PNG)

## Enable Monitoring & Observability

In this final section, we will enable Monitoring & Observability in our Virtual Machine and App Service to observe the effects of our tests.

### Azure Monitor
We can set up alerts to fire when a resource meets certain conditions, we will set up an email to fire when requests are more or equal than 10.

In udacitytest-AppService, go to Monitoring and click on Alert, then + New Rule.

In Condition we will select ```Requests (Platform)```, in Alert logic we will select for Operator ```Greater than or equal to``` and Threshold value as 10. Leave the rest of the configuration as is.

In Actions we will add an action group, then create an action group named ```actionGroupUdacity```. In Notification we will select for Notification Type ```Email/SMS message/Push/Voice.```. We will add our email, and for name we will set it as ```emailNotification```.

We will leave other configurations as is an jump to Review + Create. We will hit Create.

Finally we will add our Alert Rule Details. we will set it as ```10Requests``` and leave severity as ```3 - Informational```.

Finally, hit ```Create Alert Rule```

The Alert Rules should look like this:

![Alert Rules](images/alertrules.PNG)

When the alert fires, we should get an email similar to this:

![Email Alert](images/emailalert.PNG)

As we selected that we should get an alert if the AppService gets 10 requests or more, let's look at the requests graph available in the Azure Portal.

![Requests Graph](images/alertgraph.PNG)

In this graph we can see that the number of requests went above 10.

We can also see the severity of our alerts in the ```Alerts``` section of the App Service

![Alerts Monitor](images/alertsmonitor.PNG)

### Azure Log Analytics
As we previously configured Azure Log Analytics, we can check in the Azure Portal the outputs of the Selenium Test Suite. For this we will configure custom logs.

To configure custom logs go to your Log Analytics Workspace -> Settings -> Custom logs -> Upload sample log.

We will download and use the selenium-test.log artifact that we set up earlier in the pipeline, it must have logs similar to this:

```bash

2021-07-08 05:42:30 6 items removed from cart successfully.
2021-07-08 05:42:30 Selenium Tests DONE
```

In Record delimiter we will select ```New line```.

In Collection paths we will select ```Linux``` and in Path we will put the path where the logs are located, in our case ```/home/george/azagent/_work/1/s/log/selenium/selenium-test.log```

In Details, we will define the Custom log name as ```SeleniumTestLogs```.

Finally, in Review + Create we will create the custom log.

We can query it in the Logs section of Log Analytics Workspace by writing ```SeleniumTestLogs_CL```

## Future Work
- We could cause errors or other scenarios for the AppService/VM and demonstrate those behaviors in the test suites as well as in Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
- We could create a VM Scale Set in Terraform and complete each of the steps with the VM Scale set.
